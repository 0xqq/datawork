 * An annotation that marks a {@link Job} class as one that makes updates to its

 * <code>JobDataMap</code> when execution completes. 
 *   
 * <p>Jobs that are marked with this annotation should also seriously consider
 * using the {@link DisallowConcurrentExecution} annotation, to avoid data
 * storage race conditions with concurrently executing job instances.</p>
